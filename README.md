Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is basically applying, engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
The imporatnace of software engineering in the technology indusry is very crucial as it is the system that guarantees that software applications are being created and without it, there would be a deficiency in modern day technology as the applications which are as a result of software engineering are very useful to human life both in heathcare, communication, commerce and many more sectors.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
3 key milestones in the evolution of software engineering are;
A. the 1960's when it was established as a discipline
B. the 1970's which was the advent of programming
C. the 2000's which was when agile methodology began

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Software development life cycle has 6 phases which are;
1. Requirement - this phase is all about researching and gathering information about what the user or system requires. it is finding out the problem that the software intended to create would solve and what would be required in order to develop that software
2. Design - this is the second stage. After the problem has been identified in the first stage, this second stage creates a draft of what the software to be created would look like. It designs the software architecture and user interface
3. Implementation - this is the third stage and the level where work begins to be done in order to build the software. In this stage, codes are written in accordance to the design specifications that had been put in place in the second stage
4. Testing - after the codes have been written to build the software, it has to be tested to ensure that it is working and doing what it's supposed to do
5. Deployment - at this stage, the work is complete and the software is being released to the end user
6. Maintaince - in this stage, constant checks are carried out to ensure the software continues to work and new updates as well as enhancements are also made

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology follows the software development life cycle step by step whereas the Agile methodology does not necessarily follow a pattern like Waterfall does but instead, is flexible and iteractive.
Examples of scenarios where each would be appropratite;
1. The waterfall aprroach would be appropriate in a scenerio whereby its a small project and the requirements for the software to be developed are clear and unlikely to change thereby making it easy to follow the pattern of the software development life cycle. For example, building a mobile app. Building a commerce mobile app like an app for a wig business would be very easy to follow the waterfall methodology because it is a small project that is not complex and once the customer explains all they need, it  is easy to follow the pattern of the software development life cycle and implement the waterfall methodology to implement the project
2. The agile methodology on the other hand would be more appropraite in a scenario where the project is big and complex and the requirements are not clear and precise as using agile in this scenario would allow for continous adaptation whenever the needs of the project changes.  For rxample, building a healthcare app like a hospital app. Such a project is a rather complex one as there has to be different services enlisted in it from onlne consultations, to booking an appointment to choosing a preferred healthcare worker and many more segments. Sometimes, the hospital might not be certain of how they want the end result to look or they might keep coming up with new ideas in bewtween that they would like to add to the project. Hence, adopting the Agile methodology would be more convenient in this scenario.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. A Software developer's role is to write codes and implement software solutions
2. The role of a quality assurance engineer is to guarantee that the software built by the developer is of good quality and to acertain this, the qulity asssurance engineer runs tests on the software
3. The role of the project manager is to oversee the whole process of the software development; from the planning, execution and delivery of the software project
   
   
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated development environments (IDEs) are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. it's importance is the fact that it is crucial in software development as without it, codes cannot be written and hence softwares cannot be built. Examples of IDEs are; Visual studio and Eclipse
2. Version control systems are the software tools used for tracking changes to source codes and coordinating work among members. It is important because without it, it would not be possible to make changes to existing codes that have already been written and other team members would not be able to see or make an input in the project. Examples of VCS are Git and Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Common challenes faced by software engineers are;
1. Changing requireents where the requirements for the project constantly change during the lifecycle of the project leading to scope creep and project delays. The best strategy to overcome this challenge is to utilize the agile methodology which is flexible and can accomodate any changes that arise in the course of the project
2. Tight deadlines where there is pressure to deliver the software products on a schedule which can result to rushed development and compromised quality. The best strategy to deal with this challenge is proper and effective communication from the customer on the deadline of the project in order to avoid last minute rushes and compromised quali
3. Technical debts accrued from shortcuts or suboptional solutions. The strategy to overcome this challenge is simply prioritization of tasks to ensure that there are no impedements to the development efforts and no increase in maintainace costs

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
The different types of testing and their importance are;
1. unit testing which is testing individual components or modules of a software. It's mportantance in software quality assurance is that it ensures that each unit of the software functions properly as it should
2. integration testing which examines interactions between different components or subsystems. It is important in software quality assurance because it ensures the the various components effectively work together and not just as individual units
3. system testing which tests the entire software sytem as a whole. System testing is important in software quality assurance as it gurantees that the software actually works
4. acceptance testing which is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. This is important in software quality assurance because it ensures that the software is in accoradnce with what the customer wanted.
The importance of quality control in general is to help identify and fix defects early in the development process thereby leading to higher quality software products


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting of input prompts to AI to influence their outputs and elicit a desired response.
The importance of prompt engineering in interacting with AI models is to allow developers shape the behavior of AI models and enable them to produce more accurate, relevant and human like responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of a vague prompt is "Write something intresting"
A more clear, specific and concise prompt is "Write something intresting about Nigeria"
The improved prompt is more effective because its clear and gives the AI direct instruction of what I want it to write about unlike the first prompt which is broad and not specific.
